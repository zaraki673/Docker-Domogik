Purpose
=======

plcbus.basic Message specification
====================================

* Class = PLCBUS
* Type = BASIC 

xpl-cmnd
--------

This sends a command to the plcbus plugin. The usercode used is always the same in one house (it only changes if we manage a plcbus system in many houses near from each others). ACK may be ignored if not usable with the defined COMMAND. ::

    PLCBUS.BASIC
    {
    USERCODE=<plcbus network usercode>
    DEVICE=<sensor name>
    COMMAND=<value sent to the device>
    [ACK=<0|1>]
    [DATA1=<additional data>]
    [DATA2=<additional data>]
    }

.. todo:: 

    * explain more Usercode and Device (with examples)
    * check if ACK is used or not
    * list of available COMMAND values
    * DATA1 and DATA2 : description of usage


xpl-stat
--------

It is used to send a message when a command is received *from* the plcbus network (for ex, is sent by a remote). ::

    PLCBUS.BASIC
    {
    USERCODE=<plcbus network usercode>
    DEVICE=<device name>
    COMMAND=<value sent to the device>
    [DATA1=<additional data>]
    [DATA2=<additional data>]
    }

xpl-trig
--------

This is used to send an acknowledge when an ack command is received or when an event is raised. ::

    PLCBUS.BASIC
    {
    USERCODE=<plcbus network usercode>
    DEVICE=<device name>
    COMMAND=<value sent to the device>
    ACK=1
    [DATA1=<additional data>]
    [DATA2=<additional data>]
    }

Find below manual commands examples, assuming your usercode is "FF":

Turn ON A1: ::

    dmg_send xpl-cmnd plcbus.basic "device=A1,command=ON,usercode=FF"

Turn OFF A1: ::

    dmg_send xpl-cmnd plcbus.basic "device=A1,command=OFF,usercode=FF"

Preselect Dimmer to 40% on A1: ::

    dmg_send xpl-cmnd plcbus.basic "device=A1,command=PRESET_DIM,usercode=FF,data1=40"

Preselect Dimmer to 40% with 3 secondes Fade Rate on A1: ::

    dmg_send xpl-cmnd plcbus.basic "device=A1,command=PRESET_DIM,usercode=FF,data1=40,data2=3"

Preselect No Fade Rate on A1: ::

    dmg_send xpl-cmnd plcbus.basic "device=A1,command=PRESET_DIM,usercode=FF,data2=0"

Turn ALL Ligths OFF: ::
