Manager Overview
================

Purpose
=======

The manager is the one which will start, stop and monitor all the others components (dbmgr, rest, plugins, ...). It will also manage the packages (installation, ...).

You can have several managers on a multihost installation.

You can call it with the **dmg_manager** command.


Design
======

The plugins manager is a xPL plugin (heritates of *domogik.xpl.common.plugin.XplPlugin*).
When it starts, it connects to the xPL network and wait for messages.

Depending on the options passed at startup, it will be able to start: ::

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d                    Start database manager if not already running.
  -r                    Start scenario manager if not already running.
  -p                    Activate background ping for all plugins.
  -E                    This manager is the one who looks for hardware.
  -t CUSTOM_PING_DURATION
                        Time for xpl ping duration (default : 10)
  -w WAIT_TIME_BETWEEN_PING
                        Time between 2 xpl ping (default : 15)
  -V, --version         Display Domogik version.
  -f                    Run the plugin in foreground, default to background.


It will then wait and listen for *domogik.system* and *domogik.package* xPL command messages.

Auto-refresh the enabled plugins list
=====================================

When the Domogik configuration file is updated, the manager reloads it (so there is no need to restart the manager after enabling a plugin).

xPL commands
============

See :doc:`the dedicated page </technical/xpl/internal>`.

Multi host
==========

On a multi host system, there are 2 sorts of managers : 

* the master which is only on the main host. 
* the secondaries which are on all the others hosts. 

Master manager
--------------

On startup this manager will start **dbmgr**, **rest** and the plugins. It will also look for external members.



Secondaries managers
--------------------

These managers only handle the plugins on the host (start, stop, monitor, installation).
You must not add these options to a secondary manager : -d, -r or -H !!
