==============
REST /xpl-cmnd
==============

The **/xpl-cmnd** url is used to send directly an xPL message over the xPL network.

This usage must be avoided as often as possible. See :doc:`REST-command|/command </technical/rinor/rest_command>` for sending orders to specific plugins.

When can we use */xpl-cmnd* in an UI ? 
============================================

* The UI has to interact with an xPL software or hardware that is not part of the Domogik project.
* You want to test a specific plugin by sending an xPL message.

So, don't forget to ask yourself "Do I really need to send directly a command without using facilities offered by :doc:`REST-command|/command </technical/rinor/rest_command>` and others REST method given by Domogik project ?".

For example, official User Interface doesn't use this feature.

URI format 
==========

Here is the URI format (replace REST by ip:port of REST server): ::

    http://REST/xpl-cmnd/<schema>/<key1>/<value1>/<key2>/<value2>/...

* schema : name of xPL schema. Example : *x10.basic*
* key1/value1 : couple key/value of a schema. Example : *command/ON*

The schema type will always be **xpl-cmnd**.
