How to create a package
=======================

First, what type of package do you want to create ?
===================================================
There are several types of packages :

* Plugins
* External members

Plugins
-------
Plugin is the main package type in Domogik. It allows you to use some devices (x10 gateway, Zwave stick, ...) or some software (web service, ...) in Domogik.

A plugin is made of :

* A json file which describes the plugin, the features, ...
* Some xml files to describe the way the database and the user interfaces will communicate with the xPL network.
* Some python files.

External members
----------------
An external member is a xPL client not linked to Domogik. It can be a product like :

* The RFXCOM xPL.
* A sqeezebox.
* An diy or arduino board with an ethernet shield and a sketch which communicate xPL.
* A xPL program made outside of Domogik (xpl-perl for example).

To interact with Domogik, some files must be created for an external member :

* A json file which describes the member and the features of the external member.
* Some xml files to describe the way the database and the user interfaces will speak with the xPL network.

.. warning ::
    Currently, for each external member you have to create some json and xml files. We will create a generic external member with some common features in order to handle some external members with classic features (temperature, ...). So, people won't have to create a package for each external client.

Then, how to create a package ?
===============================

Before creating the package
---------------------------

* Check if there is not already an existing (or in development) package for what you want to do.
* Look into :doc:`the packages life cycle <packages_lifecycle>`.

Create the package

Download :download:`SVG source file <packages_lifecycle.svg>`.

#. :doc:`Make specification <specifications>` for your package on the wiki. You can create a page wiki.domogik.org/<package type>_<package name>. Example : http://wiki.domogik.org/plugin_ipx800 for the *ipx800* plugin.
#. :doc:`Start developing the package <developing>`.
#. Write the :doc:`package documentation <documentation>` at the same time.
#. Write some :doc:`test cases <test_cases>` for the package. 
#. :doc:`Test your package <test_the_package>`.
#. :doc:`Generate the package <generate_the_package>` and send a request to upload it on a repository. 
#. :doc:`The package will be reviewed <review>` by a Domogik core team member.
