Create the package specifications
=================================

Why do we need to write specifications ?
========================================

* Writing some specification is something important : writing the way the package will work and the xpl schema used helps the developper to produce a clear code. It also helps other people to understand the code.
* In the project Domogik, the quality is very important. So, before starting to develop a package, the developper should ask the other developpers to read its package specifications : they could help to improve the way the package will be developped.
* The specification will be used after the package development to understand how the package features work.
* Developpers informations can be added in this page.

Create the page on the wiki
===========================

Create a page on the wiki : **wiki.domogik.org/<package type>/<package name>**. Examples :

* plugin ipx800: wiki.domogik.org/plugin_ipx800
* external member rfxcom: wiki.domogik.org/external_rfxcom
