Plugin configuration and startup
================================

The plugin configuration page can be accessed by :

* the **Configure** button in the installed plugins list.
* the plugin entry in the **Plugins** menu.

There are several tabs:

* *Requirements*
* *Configuration*
* Optional *special* tabs depending on the plugins.

.. warning ::
    Domogik 0.2 and Domoweb 0.2 don't currently handle *special pages* packages. So, these special pages are still included in Domoweb packages. If you use some plugins with special pages, be caution to use the latest Domoweb release compatible with Domogik 0.2!

===================

This tab give some information about the plugin :

* technology

* ...

It also indicates if the plugin is *on* or *off* and allows to *start* or *stop* it.
