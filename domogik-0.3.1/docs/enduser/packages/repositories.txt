Packages repositories
=====================

Overview
========
Packages are hosted in online repositories. The official Domogik repositories are hosted on `http://repo.domogik.org <http://repo.domogik.org>`_.

Official repositories
=====================
The officiel repositories are managed by the Domogik team. There are 4 repositories :

* **stable** : this repository hosts all stable and functionnal packages. This is the only repository activated after an installation.
* **testing** : this repository hosts the packages that are candidates to the *stable* repository*. They are fully functionnal but they have not been totally tested.
* **experimental** : this repository hosts non complete packages for testing or demo only.
* **nightly builds** : this repository is refreshed every night with packages automatically created from the sources.
