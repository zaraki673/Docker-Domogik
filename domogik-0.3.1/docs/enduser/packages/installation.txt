Packages installation
=====================

Main and secondary hosts
========================

Domogik can be installed on multiple hosts. There are two types of Domogik installations :

* the Domogik main host
* the Domogik secondary hosts

Some actions can be done only on the main host and other on all hosts :

=================================== ========= ===============
Action                              Main host Secondary hosts
=================================== ========= ===============
Update the package cache            yes       no
Install a plugin                    yes       yes
Install an external member          yes       no
=================================== ========= ===============

In the administration menu, the main hosts has a *star* icon. In this example, *ambre* is the main host and darkstar is a secondary host:

Update the package cache
========================

Updating the package cache is important. This is done on each Domogik startup and can also be done from the main host administration page in the *Repositories* tab: 

.. image:: admin_update_cache.png

Just click **Update cache** to update the cache for the listed :doc:`repositories <repositories>`.

Before searching or installing a new package, do a cache update in order to see and get the latest package releases.

Install a plugin
================

You can search for a plugin and install it from the *Plugins* tab of a host. This tab is separated in 2 parts :

* the list of the installed plugins
* the list of the available plugins (which are not already installed)

The list of the installed plugins
*********************************

The list of the installed plugins shows all installed plugins on the host :

.. image:: admin_plugin_installed.png

The list of the available plugins
*********************************

The list of the available plugins shows all available plugins :

.. image:: admin_plugin_available.png

Some plugins can be available in several versions (one version by repository):

Install a plugin
****************

Search for the plugin in the available plugins list and click **install**.

The plugin will be downloaded from the repository and installed on the host. It will now be in the installed plugins list:

.. image:: admin_plugin_install_01.png

The plugin is disabled and you need to enable it to see it in the *Plugins* menu and configure it. Just click **Enable** to enable it.

.. image:: admin_plugin_install_02.png

Now you can see the plugin in the *Plugins* menu and configure it:

.. image:: admin_plugin_list.png

Update a plugin
***************

When an update is available for a plugin, there is a new button for the plugin in the installed plugins list. Just click on it to update the plugin.

Install an external member
==========================

You can only install an external member on the main host. An external member allows to handle some xPL client (which are not part of Domogik) in Domogik.
The way to install them is similar to plugins, excepting that an external member can only be updated and uninstalled after installation. There is nothing to activate or to configure.

When an external member is detected (and installed), you will see it in the *Plugins* menu:
