===================
Set up your devices
===================

Purpose
=======
Now that you have configured your plugin(s), you can link devices to this (these) plugin(s) and put them to a place in your house.

Creating a device
=================
.. note::
    Detailed insctructions about creating, updating and deleting devices can be found on the :doc:`Devices management page </enduser/administration/device>`.

First, create your device in the administration panel : **Organization > Devices**. Be careful to indicate a valid **device address** and the corresponding **feature**.

Right now there is no auto discovery feature in Domogik to help you to find out a device address.
In some plugins there are helpers which can display available modules and their addresses. Feel free using them.

Set devices to a place
======================
To set devices to a place, you must be on the visualisation screen. From **Home Screen**, click on **Visualisation** to go to your house's visualisation screen.
For each page it will be the same process to set devices.

Go to the edition mode
----------------------
On the **Visualisation menu**, there is a **Customize** button. Clicking on it will open the **edition mode** which will allow you to set devices to places.

You may also access edition mode from the **Administration** panel : go to **Organization > Widgets** menu and you will see the list of all available places.
Just click on one place to go to the edition mode.

Screen description
------------------
When clicking on a feature you will see black squares reprensenting the widget. In this mode you won't see the widget appearance but only the size it takes on the screen.
A place area is separated in 3 sub-areas:

* **Title widget zone** (1) : here you can put only one 1x1 widget. It is commonly use to put a sensor device.
* **Main widgets zone** (2) : here, you can put up to four 1x1 widgets (only 1x1 widgets are allowed here for the moment). In visualisation mode, this zone will be seen from higher zone visualisation screen.
* **Other widgets zone** (3) : here you can put widgets you want to use/see for this place but that are less important.

A window named **Place your widgets** has been opened. In the first column, you will have to choose a device.
Then in the second column all features related to this device appear.
Select one feature : on the third column, available widgets for this device/feature are displayed.
Select one widget. Then, in the fourth column, you see a preview/description of the widget.
Juste drag on the **black representation** of the widget (window disappears) and drop it to the place you want to put it on.
