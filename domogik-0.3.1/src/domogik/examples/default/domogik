#Start domogik daemon under this user
DOMOGIK_USER=domogik

# This variable can take 6 parameters :
# -d to start the database manager (launch only on master host)
# -r to start the rest component (launch only on master host)
# -E to manage external members (launch only on master host)
# -p to regulary ping plugins 
# -t <ping duration> to customize ping duration. Default : 20
# -w <wait time between 2 ping> to customize ping delay. Default : 60
# Remember : Your domogik installation must have *one* and *only one*
# instance of each manager running.
# Your domogik installation won't start on this computer if :
#  - The database manager is not already running elsewhere on the network
#  - You do not pass -d parameter to the manager
MANAGER_PARAMS="-d -r -p -E"

# You may want to use a xPL hub which is not the one given with Domogik
# If so, set this option to 'false'
LAUNCH_DOMOGIK_XPL_HUB=true

# Two hubs are available in Domogik
# - the C hub 
# - the Domogik python hub
# By default, the Domogik python hub is used. On very slow computers, you may want to use the C hub instead.
# Possible values are: c, python
DOMOGIK_XPL_HUB=python

# You can define one or many extra path(s) for Domogik startup scripts.
# This should only be useful if you use Domogik in developement mode (with setup.py develop)
# or if you have a custom path install.
# PATH is needed to locate 1 application :
#  - xPL_Hub : the xPL hub, *not* installed by setup.py develop
CUSTOM_PATH=

# Interface where the xpl hub is supposed to listen for

# Time to wait for the server to die, in seconds
# If this value is set too low you might not
# let some servers to die gracefully and
# 'restart' will not work
DIETIME=2

# Time to wait for the server to start, in seconds
# If this value is set each time the server is
# started (on start or restart) the script will
# stall to try to determine if it is running
# If it is not set and the server takes time
# to setup a pid file the log message might
# be a false positive (says it did not start
# when it actually did)
