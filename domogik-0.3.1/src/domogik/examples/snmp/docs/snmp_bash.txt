Monitoring Domogik using SNMP
=============================


Install the bash domogik agent
==============================

This bash agent is depracated and will not be developped anymore.
Please use the perl one instead.

Edit snmpd.conf and add the domogik extension :

.. code-block:: none

    pass .1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2.255  /bin/bash /usr/sbin/dmg_snmp

This script is not installed by default. The simplest way to do it, is to create
a link from the sources :

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo ln -s /home/domogik/devel/domogik/src/domogik/examples/snmp/dmg_snmp \
    /usr/sbin/dmg_snmp

You can now restart the snmpd agent :

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo /etc/init.d/snmpd restart

Grab the data
=============

You need SNMP client tools to test the agent :

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install snmp

You can get the all available data with the command :

.. code-block:: bash

    snmpwalk -Os -c public -v 1 192.168.xxx.yyy .1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2.255

.. code-block:: none

MIB explanations
================

The application parameters

- .1.0 : The application name and version.
- .1.1 : The ip address (does not work)

The all processes data. This is the sum of the values of each plugins (including rest, manager and dbmgr). Eat some ressources when asking for.

- .2.0 : The running processes of Domogik
- .2.1 : The number of processes
- .2.2 : The pcpu key : cpu utilization of the process in "##.#" format. Currently, it is the CPU time used divided by the time the process has been running (cputime/realtime ratio), expressed as a percentage. It will not add up to 100% unless you are lucky.
- .2.3 : The pmem key : ratio of the process's resident set size to the physical memory on the machine, expressed as a percentage.
- .2.4 : The rss key : resident set size, the non-swapped physical memory that a task has used (in kiloBytes).
- .2.5 : The size key : approximate amount of swap space that would be required if the process were to dirty all writable pages and then be swapped out. This number is very rough!

The following keys (.3, .4, .5, ..) are for the main processes :

- .3.0 : The name of the process (manager, rest, ...)
- .3.1 : The PID of the the process
- .3.2 : The pcpu key : cpu utilization of the process in "##.#" format. Currently, it is the CPU time used divided by the time the process has been running (cputime/realtime ratio), expressed as a percentage. It will not add up to 100% unless you are lucky.
- .3.3 : The pmem key : ratio of the process's resident set size to the physical memory on the machine, expressed as a percentage.
- .3.4 : The rss key : resident set size, the non-swapped physical memory that a task has used (in kiloBytes).
- .3.5 : The size key : approximate amount of swap space that would be required if the process were to dirty all writable pages and then be swapped out. This number is very rough!

You can now use cacti or mrtg to grab data and graph them.

Known bugs
==========

- Version is disabled.
- IPaddress is disabled.

Developpers notes
=================

This agent is developped in bash, so it could be interressant to rewrite it in C.

It uses one script which contains many "case" imbrications. It could be a good idea
to split it in 2 :

- one for the globals applications parameters
- another for each plugins (including rest and the others)

The snmpd conf should seems like :

.. code-block:: none

    pass DOMOGIK_OID.1  /bin/bash /usr/sbin/dmg_snmp_app
    pass DOMOGIK_OID.2  /bin/bash /usr/sbin/dmg_snmp_plg manager
    pass DOMOGIK_OID.3  /bin/bash /usr/sbin/dmg_snmp_plg dbmgr
    pass DOMOGIK_OID.4  /bin/bash /usr/sbin/dmg_snmp_plg rest
    pass DOMOGIK_OID.100.1  /bin/bash /usr/sbin/dmg_snmp_plg bluez
    pass DOMOGIK_OID.100.2  /bin/bash /usr/sbin/dmg_snmp_plg dawndusk
    ...
