=============================
Monitoring Domogik using SNMP
=============================

Why?
====

Home automation systems need to be reliable. So it's important to monitor
them. SNMP is a well known service for system monitoring. It's simple to
implement and need few ressources. But keep in mind, that is will have an
impact on your computer ressources, specially on a small one ...

The perl agent uses cache to improve performance. It's possible to tune
cache performance using the config file.
It can get tatistics from a file, a python script and a rest connection.
Perl support ZMQ so it will possible to use it too.

Theses scripts are extensions to the snmpd agent.

Install snmpd
=============

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install snmpd snmp-mibs-downloader

Edit the configuration file :

.. code-block:: bash

    sudoedit /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

Change the address which snmpd must listen to :

.. code-block:: bash

    agentAddress  udp:192.168.xxx.yyy:161

Enable the public community to see all parameters. This could be consider
as a security hole. For advanced security, look at the SNMP V3 specifications :

.. code-block:: bash

    # rocommunity public  default    -V systemonly
    rocommunity public  default

There is a bug in the current package in Ubuntu and Debian.

(To de confirmed) So you must copy missing MIBS from snmp sources :

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo mkdir /usr/share/mibs/site
    sudo cp * /usr/share/mibs/site


Install domogik agent
=====================

There is 2 agents availables : one in bash and a new one in perl.

The bash agent is no more maintained, so please use the new perl agent.
Look at the corresponding documentation.
