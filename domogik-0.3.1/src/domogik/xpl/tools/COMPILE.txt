If xPL_Hub is not available for your architecture, you can compile it by hand.
You first need to have compilation tools available. On debian-like systems, you can install them using :

 apt-get install build-essential

Then :

 cd /tmp
 wget http://www.xpl4java.org/xPL4Linux/downloads/xPLLib.tgz
 cd xPLLib
 make
 cd examples
 make
 
At this step, you may get some warning about 'getprotobyname', ignore them. 
Check the hub correctly compiled : 

  file xPL_Hub

You shoud see some informations like :

 xPL_Hub: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.18, not stripped

Copy it into /usr/local/bin (or anywhere else in your path) :

 cp xPL_Hub /usr/local/bin
